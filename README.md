## Research Implications

The RookWorld results suggest that:

1. **Search-free strategic AI** is viable with appropriate training data
1. **Unified architectures** can efficiently handle multiple strategic reasoning tasks
1. **Chain-of-thought training** improves both performance and interpretability
1. **Language model paradigms** apply effectively to structured strategic domains

These findings have implications beyond chess for any domain requiring sequential decision-making under
